## Config

### Servicer

| Name | Required | Comments |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| [credential](go-storage/pairs/credential.md) | Y | support `base64` and `file` protocol: `base64` is the base64 of token content, `file` is the absolute path to token file. |

### Storager

| Name | Required | Comments |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| [name](go-storage/pairs/name.md) | Y | bucket name |
| [work_dir](go-storage/pairs/work_dir.md) | N | work dir |
| `project` | Y | google cloud project id |

## Example

Init servicer

```yaml
credential: file:<absolute_path_to_token_file>
```

Init storager

```yaml
credential: file:<absolute_path_to_token_file>
name: <bucket_name>
work_dir: /<work_dir>
project: <google_cloud_project_id>
```

## Pairs

### Server-Side Encryption (SSE)

Google Cloud Storage supports three options for Server-Side Encryption:

- Google-managed encryption keys: This is the default behaviour, no setup or configuration required.
- Customer-managed encryption keys: You can add a default KMS key to a bucket, then the objects in the bucket are encrypted/decrepted automatically. You can also encrypt an individual object with a Cloud KMS key.
- Customer-supplied encryption keys

Refer to https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption for more details.

#### Customer-managed encryption keys

| Name         | Comments                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| kms_key_name | the Cloud KMS key resource. For example, `projects/my-pet-project/locations/us-east1/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key`. |
