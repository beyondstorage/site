### Server-Side Encryption (SSE)

Azure Blob storage supports three options for Server-Side Encryption:

- Microsoft-managed keys: This is default behaviour, needs no configuration.
- Customer-managed keys: Configure customer-managed keys for the storage account, and then data will always be protected.
- Customer-provided keys

Refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption for more details.
