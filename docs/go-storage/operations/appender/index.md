`Appender` is used to maintain appendable objects.

## Workflow

- Use [create_append](./create_append.md) to create an appendable object.
- Use [write_append](./write_append.md) to write data into the object.
- Use [commit_append](./commit_append.md) to finish the append procedure. This is an optional operation.
- Use [read](../storager/read.md) to read data from the object.
