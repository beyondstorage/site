This is the weekly report for [AOS](https://aos.dev), range from 2021-03-15 to 2021-03-21.

## Application

### dm

This week we implemented the data flow related logic and next week we plan to implement the upper level business logic so that users can create and run a migration task.

## Library

### go-storage

This week we released: [v3.4.2](https://github.com/aos-dev/go-storage/releases/tag/v3.4.2)

In this release we implement multipart related fields like:

- `MultipartNumberMaximum`
- `MultipartSizeMaximum`
- `MultipartSizeMinimum`

So we can get service restrictions on multipart.

## Community

We set up following sites:

- AOS's blog: <https://aos.dev/blog>
- dm's Wiki: <https://github.com/aos-dev/dm/wiki>

We had a meeting of roadmap of 2021 Q2, slides: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jC30T4S-eFrtIUoj9QStv8UDXq65UJaJmP0R2y-HqXo/>
