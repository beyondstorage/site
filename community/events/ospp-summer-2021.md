## Projects

In this event, we provide following projects.

### WebDAV for go-storage

WebDAV is an extension to the HTTP/1.1 protocol that allows clients to perform remote Web content operations. This project will implement the go-storage Storager interface for WebDAV, enabling users to manipulate data on WebDAV servers using a unified interface.

Mentor: [xuanwo](https://matrix.to/#/@xuanwo:matrix.org)

### WebDAV for go-storage

FTP is the oldest network tool in the history of the Internet and is still widely used in many areas. This project will implement go-storage's Storager interface for FTP, enabling users to use a unified interface to manipulate data on FTP servers.

## About

## Open Source Promotion Plan

Open Source Promotion Plan encourages everyone to pay close attention to open source software and open source community, aiming to cultivate and explore more outstanding developers.

'Summer 2021' will be held in this summer. We will collaborate closely with the open source community to provide one-to-one mentor guidance and invite some specialists to conduct free online lectures. In order to promote the development of open source software and facilitate the construction of excellent open source software community, we encourage researchers, open source enthusiasts, professors as well as students to participate in the development and maintenance of open source software. Furthermore, ‘Summer 2021’ is supposed to increase the activity of open source projects, and promote the development of open source ecology.

## AOS

`AOS` is an abbreviation of `Application Oriented Storage`, we plan to build an application-oriented storage abstraction layer. For now, we are focusing our golang implementations: [go-storage](https://github.com/aos-dev/go-storage)
